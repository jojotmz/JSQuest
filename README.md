# JSQuest
SA3 Project.

All title sets were downloaded from https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii.

Files have a basic documentation mostly used by me to remember what everything is doing as I learned.

To be better explained during presentation of the project.

I run the client with ```npm run dev``` command inside ./www folder

I run the server with ```npm run dev command``` inside ./server folder

client listening on port 3000.

server on port 8080.
